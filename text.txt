The 2017 edition of the Tour de France consisted of 22 teams. All eighteen UCI WorldTeams were entitled, and obliged, to 
enter the race. On 26 January 2017, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four
second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, of which three were French-based (Cofidis, 
Direct Énergie and Fortuneo–Oscaro) and one was Belgian (Wanty–Groupe Gobert), who are riding the race for the first time.
Fortuneo–Oscaro were initially invited to the race as Fortuneo–Vital Concept,[4] before a change of sponsorship prior to the 
opening day of racing. The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the
media and local dignitaries – took place in front of a crowd of 15,000 at the Burgplatz (de) square in Düsseldorf, Germany, 
on 29 June, two days before the opening stage held in the city.

Each squad was allowed a maximum of nine riders, resulting in a start list total of 198 riders. Of these, 49 are riding the 
Tour de France for the first time. The riders come from 32 countries; France, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Belgium and Germany 
all had 13 or more riders in the race.[7] The average age of riders in the race is 29.39 years,[9] ranging from the 
22-year-old Élie Gesbert (Fortuneo–Oscaro) to the 40-year-old Haimar Zubeldia (Trek–Segafredo).[10][11] Cannondale–Drapac 
has the youngest average age while Team Dimension Data has the oldest.
